<p>I graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University, and my first job after graduation was working as a product manager for a game company. In the work of this company, I came into contact with AR, and I found that I was very interested in AR. Then I learned programming and Unity. Finally, I was very fortunate to join EasyAR, a well-known AR company in China, as a Unity development engineer.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I quit my job and prepared to start my own business. After thinking for a long time, I finally combined my strengths and interests to create a studio named Foresees Future Studio.</p>

<p>On this website, I will share with you the Unity development process or AR-related development tutorials and matters needing attention, I hope to provide you with some help.</p>
